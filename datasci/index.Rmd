<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

<!-- The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("bookdown") -->
<!-- # or the development version -->
<!-- # devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`. -->

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
    .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
