Within one day after the deadline of an assignment, you will find your
randomly assigned classmate on HuskyCT.


Email your solution to your assigned classmate, exactly as you
submitted it online. You have 1 day to provide your feedback. 


You have to submit your feedback on HuskyCT. For example, for Homework
1, there will be a follow-up assignment called "Homework 1 -
feedback". There, you will enter your numeric assessment using the
following scale:

+ 1 = missing, or totally inadequate
+ 2 = requires a major revision
+ 3 = requires a minor revision
+ 4 = complete and accurate solution

A template for the feedback is provided on HuskyCT.


If revisions are necessary, provide the necessary details in the
designated box.


Note that your assessment will NOT affect your partner's grade! The
purpose of this process is to learn from each other and develop good
programming and communication skills, so please be thorough and
honest, but also polite.


In addition to posting your comments on HuskyCT, send them to your
assigned classmate. If your own homework requires revisions, you must
complete them within 2 days after receiving the feedback. Share your
revision with your assigned classmate to get his/her approval, and
upload the correction to HuskyCT. Feel free to communicate with your
assigned grader if you need clarifications or help.
