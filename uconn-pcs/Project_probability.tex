\begin{document}
Three players enter a room and a red or blue hat is placed on each
  person's head.  The color of each hat is determined by an independent coin
  toss. No communication of any sort is allowed, except for an initial strategy
  session before the game begins.  Once they have had a chance to look at the
  other hats but not their own, the players must simultaneously guess the
  color of their own hats or pass. The puzzle is to find a group strategy that
  maximizes the probability that at least one person guesses correctly and
  no-one guesses incorrectly. Use simulation to approximate the probability of success for the following strategies.
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
  \item One person guesses and the others pass (0.5). 
  \item For each person, guess the color he/she does
    not see if he/she see same colors, and pass is he/she sees different
    colors (0.75).
  \end{enumerate}
