\chapter{Hypothesis Testing}\label{ch:hypothesis}}

Hypothesis testing can be thought of as a stochastic analog of proof by
contradiction.

``To understand the essence of statistical hypothesis testing properly, it is
necessary to compare intentionally hypothesis testing with proof by
contradiction and characterize the former as not the same as the latter.''
\citep{otani2019comparing}.

It should be relatively clear, then, why a failure to reject H , does not
constitute a verification of its truth. It simply means that the researcher has
failed to provide evidence suflcient to cast serious doubt on the truth of
\(H_0\). \citep{reeves1980hypothesis}
